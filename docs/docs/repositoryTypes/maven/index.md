# Maven Repository

Maven Repositories have two modes.

- **Hosted** - The repository is hosted on the server and is used to store artifacts. This is used to create a regular Maven Repository.
- **Proxy** - The repository is a proxy to another repository. This is used to cache artifacts from another repository.
