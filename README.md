Nitro Repo is an open source free artifact manager. Written with a Rust back end and a Vue front end to create a fast
and modern experience.

### History

After years of using Nexus and then a bit of time of using StrongBox I decided I should design my own Artifact Manager
to create a fast and modern experience.

### Technical Side

Backend:  Rust using Actix.

Frontend: Vue and Typescript
